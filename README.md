**This library is no longer actively maintained.** The Authy API has been replaced with the [Twilio Verify API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify). Twilio will support the Authy API through November 1, 2022 for SMS/Voice. After this date, weâ€™ll start to deprecate the service for SMS/Voice. Any requests sent to the API after May 1, 2023, will automatically receive an error.  Push and TOTP will continue to be supported through July 2023.

# Ruby Client for Twilio Authy Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) API

Documentation for Ruby usage of the Authy API lives in the [official Twilio documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/).

The Authy API supports multiple channels of 2FA:
* One-time passwords via SMS and voice.
* Soft token ([TOTP](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp) via the Authy App)
* Push authentication via the Authy App

If you only need SMS and Voice support for one-time passwords, we recommend using the [Twilio Verify API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api) instead.

[More on how to choose between Authy and Verify here.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/authy-vs-verify)

### Authy Quickstart

For a full tutorial, check out either of the Ruby Authy Quickstart in our docs:

* [Ruby/Rails Authy Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/quickstart/two-factor-authentication-ruby-rails)

## Authy Ruby Installation

```
gem install authy
```

## Usage

To use the Authy client, require the `authy` gem and initialize it with our API URI and your production API Key found in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/authy/applications/):

```ruby
require 'authy'

Authy.api_uri = 'https://api.authy.com'
Authy.api_key = 'your-api-key'
```

Rails users can put this in config/initializers and create a new file called `authy.rb`.

## 2FA Workflow

1. [Create a user](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/users#enabling-new-user)
2. [Send a one-time password](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/one-time-passwords)
3. [Verify a one-time password](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/one-time-passwords#verify-a-one-time-password)

**OR**

1. [Create a user](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/users#enabling-new-user)
2. [Send a push authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/push-authentications)
3. [Check a push authentication status](https://www.twilio.com/docs/authy/api/push-authentications#check-approval-request-status)


## <a name="phone-verification"></a>Phone Verification

[Phone verification now lives in the Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api) and has [Ruby support through the official Twilio helper libraries](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/ruby).

[Legacy (V1) documentation here.](verify-legacy-v1.md) **Verify V1 is not recommended for new development. Please consider using [Verify V2](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api)**.

## Demo

See the [`./examples`](./examples) directory for a demo CLI application that uses the Authy API.

## Contributing
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Add tests.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit.

## Notice: Twilio Authy APIâ€™s Sandbox feature will stop working on Sep 30, 2021
Twilio is discontinuing the Authy APIâ€™s Sandbox, a feature that allows customers to run continuous integration tests against a mock Authy API for free. The Sandbox is no longer being maintained, so we will be taking the final deprecation step of shutting it down on September 30, 2021. The rest of the Authy API product will continue working as-is.

This repo previously used the sandbox API as part of the test suite, but that has been since removed.

You will only be affected if you are using the sandbox API in your own application or test suite.

For more information please read this article on [how we are discontinuing the Twilio Authy sandbox API](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803396889-Notice-Twilio-Authy-API-s-Sandbox-feature-will-stop-working-on-Sep-30-2021).
